## Endpoints
This blog consist of primarily following endpoints:
| Route               | Working    |   
|:-------------------:|:----------:|
| `/api/*`            | Users        | 
| `/api/properties/*` | Properties |

### User Router
|Protocol|Route|
|:---:|:---:|
|`POST`|`/login`|
|`POST`|`/signup`|

### Properties Router
|Protocol|Route|Middleware|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|`GET`|`/all-list`|public|
|`GET`|`/my-list`|private|
|`PUT`|`/add`|private|
|`PUT`|`/update/:id`|private|
|`PUT`|`/delete/:id`|private|

## Authentication
For Authentication this project uses `JWT`, here is the basic flow of authentication:

- If `/api/login` endpoint got a call it generate a `Bearar Token` using `JWT`
- This token is not stored inside our Database, and is generated everytime when endpoint is called

## Middleware
- As there exists some routes that are needed to be `public` or `private`, thus this project utilizes great abstraction layer of middleware
- This middleware takes `Bearar Token` that was generated by `JWT` inside header
- It spits out user and all its details expect for `password`

## Database Config
- The project uses `MongoDB Atlas` as `NoSQL`
- To connect `Express Server` with **DB**, `Mongoosejs` is used as **ORM**
